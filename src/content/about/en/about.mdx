Front-end developer based in Asunci√≥n, Paraguay. Self-taught and passionate about technology

I transitioned to software development from music, learned to play the cello and was a member of 
several orchestras. This experience helped me develop skills in teamwork, discipline, and focus, 
which are now integral to my daily software development work

Over the last four years, I have dedicated myself to focusing on front-end technologies and tools:

- Frameworks: React, Next.js, Astro
- CSS Tools: SASS, TailwindCSS, Styled Components
- Component Libraries: MUI
- Testing: Playwright, Puppeteer, Storybook
- Upcoming: Exploring mobile development with React Native

I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering to complement my self-taught knowledge. 
It has allowed me to get contact with languages like C, Java, and SQL, and to delve into concepts 
such as Object-Oriented Programming. The pandemic provided an interesting opportunity to collaborate 
and learn remotely with excellent classmates

Beyond programming, I have a keen interest in user interface design, Linux, and mechanical keyboards. 
In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, reading science fiction and thriller novels, 
listening to music, and English podcasts
