I am a **self-taught developer** with a passion for learning and building things

What I love about programming is that it allows me to be **creative** and **solve problems**, entering the world 
of CSS, and watching how lines of code could translate into incredible illustrations that can be created
with just the keyboard was a mind-blowing experience, it trapped me even more into the world of web 
development and right-away setted myself the goal of creating an animated illustration and after understanding 
the intricacies of CSS animations was able to create one of my own ðŸŽ‰ 

Currently, I have the opportunity of **working remotely** for a small software development company from Barcelona, 
Spain, in a **multicultural team** with people from Argentina, Ireland and Paraguay, where we work with technologies such as 
React, MUI and TypeScript, allongside Git and GitHub for version control and code review

Pursuing a degree in **Computer Science** has exposed me to other programming languages like Java and C, 
and where I took an UI/UX workshop that sparked **interest** in **user interface design** and tools like Figma

Staying **up to date** with the **latest technologies** in the industry is a **priority** for me, I am **very grateful**
with the people that shares their knowledge and experience in the form of blog posts, videos and podcasts,
this allowed me to learn NextJS, Astro, TailwindCSS and testing with Playwright, I also enjoy working 
with Linux and the command line interface  

Before coding, had the opportunity to play in different orchestras and ensembles as a cello player with 
awesome musicians, this experience taught me the importance of **teamwork and communication** to achieve a 
**common goal**

In my free time I like having time with my family, taste coffe and enjoying science fiction and 
thriller novels, as well as a few tv-shows, video games and music
