I am a self-taught, passionate front-end developer from Asunci√≥n, Paraguay.

I entered in the world  of software development from music, where I learned to play the cello and was a member of some orchestras in my country. There, I developed teamwork skills, discipline, and the ability to focus and find the best way to overcome the challenges of each musical piece.

Currently, I have the opportunity to work remotely for a company in Barcelona, Spain, in a multicultural team. I work with technologies like JavaScript, React, MUI, TypeScript, Playwright, among others. Additionally, I am proficient in working with Linux, command line interfaces, and tools like Git and GitHub.

I am pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering, where I have been exposed to other programming languages like Java and C, also participated in an interesting UI/UX workshop that sparked my interest in user interface design and Figma.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, reading science fiction and thriller novels, and listening to music and podcasts in English.
