I am a **self-taught developer** with a passion for learning and building things

What I love about programming is that it allows me to be **creative** and **solve problems**, entering the world 
of CSS, and watching how lines of code could translate into incredible illustrations created
with just the keyboard blew my mind. Right-away, I set myself the goal of creating one, and I did. ðŸŽ‰ 

Currently, I have the opportunity of **working remotely** for a small software development company from Barcelona, 
Spain, in a **multicultural team** with people from Argentina, Ireland and Paraguay, where we work with technologies such as 
React, MUI and TypeScript, allongside Git and GitHub for version control and code review

Pursuing a degree in **Computer Science** has exposed me to other programming languages like Java and C, 
and where I took an UI/UX workshop that sparked **interest** in **user interface design** and tools like Figma

Staying **up to date** with the **latest technologies** in the industry is a **priority** for me, I am very grateful
with the people that shares their knowledge and experience in the form of blog posts, videos and podcasts,
this allowed me to learn NextJS, Astro, TailwindCSS and testing with Playwright, I also enjoy working 
with Linux and the command line interface  

Before coding, had the opportunity to play in different orchestras and ensembles as a cello player with 
awesome musicians, this experience taught me the importance of **teamwork and communication** to achieve a 
**common goal**

In my free time I like having time with my family, taste coffe and enjoying science fiction and 
thriller novels, as well as a few tv-shows, video games and music
