I'm a **software developer** currently focused on the development of **responsive**, **SEO-optimized**, and **accessible** web applications and websites, 
using technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React**. I'm always learning new technologies, which has led me to build projects with 
**NextJS** and **Astro**, and I'm looking to expand my skill set with the addition of **NodeJS** and **Express**.

I am very confident with the command line and the use of **git** and **GitHub** for version control and collaboration. I use **Linux** almost exclusively, 
currently running my development environment on the Fedora operating system.

I'm studying **Computer Science** at [Universidad Autónoma de Asunción](https://www.uaa.edu.py/), where I took a course in **UI/UX** apart from the regular 
courses of the career. There, I also gained a good foundation in **Java** and **Spring Boot**. 

Before coding, I worked at a few orchestras in my country as a cello player, where I had the opportunity to play with great musicians and conductors. 

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family and tasting coffee from different regions of the world. There is no greater pleasure for me than to 
start the day coding with a cup of v60, French press, or cold brew coffee that I've prepared myself. I also enjoy reading science fiction and thriller books.
