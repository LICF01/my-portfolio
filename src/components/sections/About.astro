  <Text as="p" variant="paragraph" class="mt-0">
    I'm a developer based in Asunción, Paraguay, self-taught and passionate
    about tech. Before coding, I studied music, learned to play the cello 🎻,
    and even joined an orchestra.

    After a series of events and serious consideration, I made a turnaround in
    my life and decided to focus primarily on software development 💻. I've been
    coding for about 4 years now 🕒, and my current focus is on front-end
    development, primarily using React, Next.js, and Astro 🚀. I'm also going
    slowly but consistently through university to get a degree in computer
    science 🎓 and where I had fun with languages like C and Java.

    Apart from coding, my interests include UI design 🎨, Linux 🐧, keyboards
    ⌨️, and reading science fiction and thriller-related books 📚 when I want to
    relax and improve my vocabulary. I also enjoy podcasts and, of course,
    listening to music.

    In summary, music helped me to develop a consistent focus and discipline,
    which where fundamentals at the beggining of my learning process and which
    I'm applying to my new career, this have reawakened an enthusiasm for
    learning and improving myself 🌱.
