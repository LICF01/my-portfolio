      I'm a developer based in Asunci√≥n, Paraguay, self-taught that enjoys
      coding.

    <Text as="p" class="text-foreground">
      Currently my focus is front-end development with React and Next.js, but
      I'm always having fun with new technologies and looking forward in
      learning new things.

    <Text as="p" class="text-foreground">
      Apart from coding, I enjoy UI design, linux, keyboards, science fiction
      and thrillers related books podcasts and music. Somehow I learned to play
      the cello and managed to enter an orchestra, but I'm not that good at it.
