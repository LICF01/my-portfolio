    Apart from coding, my interests include UI design, Linux 🐧, keyboards ⌨️,
    and science fiction and thriller-related books, as well as podcasts as I
    want to improve my english, and also music.

    I've also learned to play the cello 🎻 and even joined an orchestra, it's
    been an interesting journey. Though I have much to explore in music, after
    serious consideration, I've decided to primarily focus on software
    development.

    person, who can work both independently and in a team. I'm always looking to
    improve my skills and learn new things.
